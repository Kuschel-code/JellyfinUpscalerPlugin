# ✨ Plugin Features

The AI Upscaler Plugin v1.4.0 is packed with features designed for both quality and performance.

## 🧠 AI Upscaling Engine
The heart of the plugin uses **ONNX Runtime** to execute state-of-the-art neural networks.
- **Real-ESRGAN**: The gold standard for photo and anime upscaling.
- **SwinIR**: Advanced transformer-based restoration for complex scenes.
- **FSRCNN**: Lightweight models for systems with limited resources.

## ⚡ Hardware Acceleration
We maximize your hardware potential:
- **NVIDIA CUDA**: Dedicated support for RTX/GTX GPUs.
- **Windows DirectML**: High-performance upscaling for AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA on Windows.
- **Multi-Threading**: Optimized CPU processing for NAS and servers without dedicated GPUs.

## 🔍 AI Comparison View
Don't just take our word for it—see it for yourself.
- **Live Preview**: Generate a side-by-side comparison for any item in your library.
- **Before vs After**: Toggle between the original source and the AI-enhanced output.
- **Model Comparison**: Test different AI models on the same frame to find your favorite.

## 📊 Hardware Benchmarking
The plugin includes a heuristic-based benchmarking system that:
- Detects your GPU vendor and VRAM.
- Estimates frames-per-second (FPS) for different models.
- Automatically recommends the optimal configuration for your specific server.

## 🎬 Player Integration
The user interface is built directly into Jellyfin:
- **Quick Menu**: Control upscaling settings without leaving the player.
